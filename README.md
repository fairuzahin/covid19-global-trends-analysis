COVID-19 Global Trends Analysis
Overview

This project analyzes global COVID-19 data, focusing on trends in confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths. The data is visualized to show how the pandemic evolved across different regions over time.
Data Sources

The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from public COVID-19 data sources, and includes:

    Confirmed cases
    Recovered cases
    Death counts

Files used:

    worldwide-aggregate.csv: Global confirmed, recovered, and death counts by date.
    Additional files covering regional data (available in the repository).

Project Structure

    data/: Contains the datasets used in this project.
    notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts containing the analysis and code.
    images/: Saved images of the data visualizations.
    README.md: Project overview and guide.

Key Features

    Trend Analysis: Time-series analysis of global confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths.
    Visualization: Graphical representation of COVID-19's growth globally.
    Insights: Key points of interest in the pandemic's progression, including surges and plateaus.

Setup Instructions

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/covid19-global-trends-analysis.git
cd covid19-global-trends-analysis

Install the required Python libraries:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Add a requirements.txt file if needed for your dependencies, e.g., pandas, matplotlib, etc.)

Run the analysis:

    If using a Jupyter Notebook, open covid19_analysis.ipynb to view the code and run the cells.
    Alternatively, run the Python script:

    bash

        python analysis_script.py

Results

Here is a sample of the visualizations generated:

Next Steps

    Country-specific analysis: Future work could focus on analyzing specific countries or regions, comparing their recovery and death rates.
    Predictive models: Add forecasting models to predict future trends using historical data.
